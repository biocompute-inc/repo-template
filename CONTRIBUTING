# Contributing Guidelines

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Thanks for considering contributing.

## Branching
- `main`: production-ready code
- `dev`: integration branch
- `feature/<name>`: for new features
- `bugfix/<name>`: for bug fixes

## Workflow
1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Commit changes with clear messages (e.g., `feat: add upload progress bar`)
3. Push branch and open a Pull Request (PR) against `dev`
4. Ensure:
   - All tests pass
   - PR references an issue (`Fixes #123`)
   - PR template is filled

## Code Style
- Follow project linting rules
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add/update tests when changing features

## Reviews
- At least 1 reviewer approval required
- No direct commits to `main`
